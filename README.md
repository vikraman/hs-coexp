This is a toy library which explores some ideas around continuations and co-exponentials. Some details are available on
the [slides here](https://vikraman.org/files/lfcs23-coexp.pdf).

Any contributions and suggestions are most welcome.

Here are some other repositories which also explore continuations and co-exponentials:
